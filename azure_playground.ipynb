A simple thought experiment (the “light clock”)  \\n   – Imagine a clock made of two mirrors facing each other, with a light beam bouncing between them.  \\n   – Each bounce is one “tick.”  \\n   – If this clock moves sideways very fast, from an outside observer’s point of view the light has to travel a longer, slanted path between the mirrors.  \\n   – Since light always moves at the same speed, it takes more time between bounces—and so the moving clock ticks more slowly.\\n\\n3. What this means in practice  \\n   – If you flew in a spaceship at, say, 90% of light speed for an hour (by your onboard clock), someone back on Earth would measure more than an hour passing for them—maybe 2 hours or more, depending on your speed.  \\n   – You’d age less than your twin who stayed on Earth.\\n\\n4.
